# Yoga-Posture-Detection
Yoga has become popular throughout the world. Lockdown months during the period of
COVID-19 has made it difficult for people to go outside for exercise and get proper
guidance and training from professionals in order to practice yoga with proper posture.
Most people, while practising yoga themselves, face difficulties in finding the incorrect
parts of their yoga poses by themselves. Practising yoga asanas in an improper way
may cause acute injuries. Yoga pose detection and analysis will help people not only in classifying the
pose but also in checking how well their pose is as compared to a perfect yoga pose
and will save people from the expenses to hire training professionals. 

## Future Aspects:
1. Allow detection for multiple individuals simultaneously since there are a lot of
scenarios where single-person pose detection is not sufficient. Suppose, if
multiple people are practicing yoga together, then multiple individuals detection is
needed so that the pose of each individual can be analysed.
2. Expand the dataset to include more postures since our current model is
classifying for only 10 yoga postures.
3. Provide more detailed step by step real-time instructions to the user so that
he/she can easily rectify the posture.
4. Currently, we have done posture analysis which works with 2D images only by
identifying the key-points. We can expand it to 3D images also by using 3D
triangulation from multiple single views which might be a challenging task.
